# Implementation Summary

## Completed Tasks

### 1. User/Company Deletion with Proper Cascade Handling ✅

**Backend Implementation:**
- Added `deleteUser()` method in `server/storage.ts` with proper cascade handling:
  - Removes user-company relationships
  - Cleans up activity logs where user was the actor
  - Updates journal entries, invoices, and bills to remove user references (sets to null)
  - Finally deletes the user record
  - Uses database transactions for data integrity

- Added `deleteCompany()` method in `server/storage.ts` with comprehensive cascade handling:
  - Validates no users are assigned before deletion
  - Deletes in proper order to respect foreign key constraints:
    - Journal entry lines → Journal entries → Bills → Invoices → Vendors → Customers → Accounts → Activity logs → Company settings → Company
  - Uses database transactions for atomicity

**Route Updates:**
- Updated `DELETE /api/users/:id` route to use real storage methods
- Updated `DELETE /api/companies/:id` route to use real storage methods
- Added proper error handling with descriptive error messages
- Prevents users from deleting their own accounts

### 2. Data Export Functionality (PDF Reports) ✅

**PDF Generation Library:**
- Created comprehensive `client/src/lib/pdfExport.ts` utility with:
  - `exportFinancialStatementToPDF()` - Generates PDF reports for P&L, Balance Sheet, and Trial Balance
  - `exportElementToPDF()` - Generic HTML-to-PDF converter
  - `exportInvoiceToPDF()` - Invoice PDF generation
  - Proper formatting, company headers, and financial calculations

**Frontend Integration:**
- Updated Financial Statements page with working PDF export button
- Uses React Query for data fetching
- Proper error handling and user feedback via toast notifications
- Imports PDF libraries dynamically for better performance

**Backend Enhancement:**
- Enhanced company data export route to include all related records:
  - Accounts, Journal Entries, Customers, Vendors, Invoices, Bills
  - Uses parallel data fetching for better performance
  - Proper activity logging with record counts

### 3. Missing Frontend Pages Implementation ✅

**Accounts Receivable Page (`client/src/pages/accounting/AccountsReceivable.tsx`):**
- Complete customer invoice management interface
- Summary cards showing total receivable, overdue amounts, and outstanding invoices
- Invoice table with status badges (Draft, Sent, Paid, Overdue)
- Record payment functionality with dialog
- Real-time data fetching from `/api/invoices` endpoint
- Proper loading states and error handling

**Accounts Payable Page (`client/src/pages/accounting/AccountsPayable.tsx`):**
- Vendor bill management interface
- Summary cards for total payable, overdue amounts, and outstanding bills
- Bills table with status management
- Pay bill functionality
- Real-time data fetching from `/api/bills` endpoint
- Consistent UI patterns with other accounting pages

**Bank Reconciliation Page (`client/src/pages/accounting/BankReconciliation.tsx`):**
- Complete bank reconciliation workflow
- Reconciliation setup with date and balance entry
- Three-tab interface: Bank Transactions, Journal Entries, Matched Items
- Interactive transaction selection with checkboxes
- Real-time difference calculation
- Status badges and visual indicators for matched/unmatched items
- Action buttons for matching transactions and completing reconciliation
- Currently uses mock data (marked for future API integration)

**Route Integration:**
- Updated `client/src/App.tsx` to include routes for all three new pages:
  - `/accounts-receivable`
  - `/accounts-payable` 
  - `/bank-reconciliation`
- All routes properly protected and integrated with the existing layout

## Technical Implementation Details

### Database Operations
- All deletion operations use database transactions for ACID compliance
- Proper foreign key constraint handling

- Supports multiple report types with consistent formatting
- Company branding and header information
- Proper currency and date formatting
- Professional report layouts

### Frontend Architecture
- Consistent UI patterns across all new pages
- React Query for efficient data fetching and caching
- TypeScript interfaces for type safety
- Component reusability with shadcn/ui components
- Proper loading states and error handling
- Toast notifications for user feedback

### API Integration
- All new pages integrate with existing API endpoints
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Real-time data updates via React Query
- Consistent data fetching patterns
